        <h1>About</h1>

        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>This is my internet checkpoint.  My true home place for everything that identifies as me.
            As much as I appreciate the convenience of social media, I've always just needed a place away from it all.
            A place completely free from algorithms, corporate advertising, and meaningless clout chasing.
            Here, you will find out anything and everything I love and care about.
            From my hobbies and interests, to my projects, to all the random knowledge I have, it's all here!
            Enjoy your time here!  It's a mess, but then again I'm a bit of a mess, so XD
        </p>
