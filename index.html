    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>Welcome to Jack TFB's official site!  Before you enter take note.</p>
    <p>This site is mainly designed for desktop.
        I try to make it somewhat mobile friendly, but I can't promise it all works...</p>
    <p>Because it's meant to be a personal site, it's a bit disorganized.
        If you're a recruiter, I'll set up a more professional side of the site eventually.</p>
    <p>
        On top of that, there may be foul language and other things that may be inappropriate for some viewers.
        Despite the calm aesthetic of this site, it is intended for mature audiences.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're prepared, enter and enjoy.  If not, well...no pressure XD
