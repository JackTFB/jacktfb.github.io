    <h1>Hello!</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to Jack TFB's official site!  Before you enter take note.
    </p>
    <p>
        This site is mainly designed for desktop.
        I try to make it somewhat mobile friendly, but I can't promise it all works...</p>
    <p>
        Because it's meant to be a personal site, it's a bit disorganized.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you're prepared, enter and enjoy.  If not, well...no pressure XD
