        <p>To put it simply, I didn't think I would be back to writing blog posts on my own custom website again.  
        I haven't done something like this in years.  
        However, I'm in a different phase of life, and quite frankly, this seems like the only best way I can get my thoughts out there.  
        To put it simply, life's gotten crazy for me.  
        In many good ways, don't worry, but it seems like less and less of my time is being available to me to work on stuff.  
        However, I do have a light at the end of the tunnel.  
        I'm in my last year of college, and my career going forward is looking very promising.  
        With that, comes more opportunities for me to do more things.  
        However, as I've spent more time away from everything, it's made me rethink how I've wanted my online prescence to be.  
        Do I want to stick to exclusively animation, do I want to focus on game dev, do I want to be a video essay creator, or do I just want to stop creating altogether and just exist?  
        So many routes, yet no clue how to proceed forward.  
        On top of that, my perspective on social media as a whole has wanned exponentially.  
        I've grown less and less interested in growing as a creator on social media every year with how much worse each platform has become and how more deplorable some creators have become as a resort of it.  
        I've known this for years now, but it's taken me forever to admit it.  I don't want to be a number chaser.  
        I don't want to limit my creativity and ability to what a fucking number says on a dashboard.  However, my problem still remains.  
        Social media seemed to be the only way I could share my work online...or is it?  
        Over the past few months, I've grown fascinated with the idea of personal websites.  
        Places where people made their own sort of landmark on the Internet.  Their own sort of place.  
        No social media standards or expectations, just their place.  
        It's a hallmark to an era of the Internet that has long passed, but to me maybe it should be my comeback. 
        Maybe it should be my return to the Internet.  
        Instead of just relying on social media to be my place, I can just build a place of my own for all my creativity and passion to be.  
        And that's what all this is for.  A singular place for everything of my own to be kept.  
        An archive, a memorium, a landmark, however you want to call it, this is my place.  This is really what I've been needing all along.  
        Just a place for me to organize everything I do and archive my history.  
        Because no matter what happens, I can keep my history here in one place, so everyone will know where to find me.  
        I'm not entirely sure of what I'll put here, but I've already got some stuff going, but at the end of the day, this is my place.  
        And it's not going anywhere!</p>
