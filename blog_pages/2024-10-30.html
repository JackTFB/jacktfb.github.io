        <h1>Art Block</h1>
        </br>
        <p>Getting somewhere with this blog stuff.  I'll start actually formatting these as I go and clean them up as needed.  Anywho, what I wanted to talk about today is something I've been thinking about mainly when it comes to creativity and trying to get into or get back into artistic hobbies.  Recently I've decided that I'm really going to make a committment in the next upcoming months to get back into animation/art.  Also, I think I'm really gonna make a committment to get into drawing.  I really think I could enjoy getting into it and drawing art of characters from shows and games I like, as well as sketching characters from the stories I want to write.  (I am going to write my book projects I promise, just lemme cook XD)  However, that's a topic for another day.  What I wanted to talk about is something more philosophical.  It's about the idea of imposter syndrome and not feeling motivated to work on animation.  I genuinely feel like I burned out myself for a few years straight trying to make myself seem "good enough."  However, the time I've spent away has taught me more of what I did wrong in terms of animation mentality.  I believe where I went wrong was I focused way too much on what I thought would be good, when in reality I was letting the words of others get to me.  Now, this may sound like a jab at artistic criticism..........................and it is XD  Something I noticed back then, which still kind of exists depending on the person depending on who you talk to, some people feel that criticism of art is more strict and technical without realizing the oxymoron of it all.  If art is subjective, then so is criticism of art.  This seems like it would make sense to the logical person, but I feel that so many people, especially online, are very quick to criticize art as if they're doing the artist a favor.  And while in some cases it may be the case, in my particular case, for the longest time I saw criticism as the standard for my work.  If I wasn't getting praise and only getting criticism, then my work isn't great.  Now, I started to notice later on that this was definitely not the right mentality to go for when taking criticism, but funnily enough instead of learning to approach criticism with a fresh mindset, I began to reject it internally.  I began to despise criticism and any form of it.  Of course I didn't tell anyone because I didn't know what they would think of me for saying such things, but that's genuinely how I felt.  While it kind of made me feel better, I then started to feel like I was stagnating.  I wasn't going anywhere.  I wasn't able to do the cool stuff I wanted to do.  As such, I burned myself out completely until I just gave up altogether.  I made multiple attempts to come back, but they all failed in some shape or form.  I eventually felt that I could never go back to animation.  I felt like there was no way I could go back.  My time was passed, my free time was getting short, and I wasn't finding the joy I felt beforehand.  However, as of recently, I've been able to get a new perspective.  My life has started to come together, I've been able to reflect, and I have had a definite improvement in terms of mentality  towards art.  I even now am excited for the day I get to go back and commit fully to animating again.</p>
        <p>I saw all this to say, no matter what it is that you do, whether it is art, animation, music, writing, no matter what it is.  The takeaway is don't let any of the voices, internal or external, define how you feel about your art.  You're doing it for a reason, most likely to give you some sort of escape.  So treat it as such.  Don't pressure yourself into having to be perfect, or at a certain skill level to justify your work.  Your improvement will come naturally over time.  It may not happen linearly, but it will eventually happen.  Just keep at it, have that hungering spirit to improve, and keep at it!  You'll get there, I know you will!</p>
