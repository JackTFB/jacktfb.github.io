    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I am a computer science major currently enrolled at the University of North Georgia.
        I have been fascinated with technology and programming since a very young age.
        When I was 12, I started learning how to program making mods for the video game Minecraft, and ever since then my
        interests have shifted all over the place.
        I've learned game development, experimented with Linux, tested various AI tools, and the list goes on and on.
        In the middle of all that, I learned how to animate 3D animations in Blender, and have been given the opportunity to work with a few big names in the content creator space.
        I am now trying to push my way into the world of software engineering, and try to learn some more cool new things along the way.
        Maybe I'll make an indie game, maybe I'll develop the next revolutionary software, maybe I'll just be satisfied making stuff for other people.
        Who knows!  As long as I'm learning and trying stuff, I'm having fun!</p>

    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>

    <p>Known languages: Java, C#, Python, HTML, CSS</p>

    <h2>CG Animation</h2>

    <p>Tools: Blender, Davinci Resolve, Aesprite</p>

    <h2>Personal</h2>

    <p>As of right now, I do a lot of other interesting hobbies outside of programming and animation.
    This includes playing video games with friends, watching anime, reading books, and hiking.
    I'm very much a nerd, but I also love to step outside every once in a while and immerse myself in nature.
    I'm also interested once I have more free time and my career is more stable to pick up novel writing.</p>
